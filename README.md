![alt tag](https://www.codewars.com/users/shahx95/badges/large)

A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). Top 6 percentile on the global leaderboard. Pushing a solved challenge every day.

## Training:

Language/s used: <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Each morning, I do atleast one coding challenge. 

## Optimizations:

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, keeping efficiency and readability in mind. I clean up the code after getting it to work. Break up big functions into multiple smaller functions, possibly rename variables, add comments, etc.

## Lessons Learned:

Doing CodeWars daily has exposed me to coding problems I might not have encountered otherwise. This allowed me to develop thinking processes to improve my programming ability. Additionally, I gain insight into the possibilities of approaching and solving a problem by seeing what other users have done. Learning never ends.
